# Hey, I'm Julian

AI Engineer in Hamburg. I build and operate AI systems in production.

## What I do

**Agentic engineering.** I design AI systems that do real work - RAG pipelines, voice agents, document extraction, customer service automation. Not demos. Production systems handling real volume.

**n8n at scale.** From internal automations to full AI agent orchestration. Complex flows, webhooks, custom nodes, API integrations to any system you throw at me.

**Ops that don't wake you up at night.** I run what I build. Ansible for server hardening, Docker networking, automated backups, Pulumi for IaC. Grafana + Loki for observability. If it's in production, it's monitored.

**Full stack when needed.** 8+ years across Java, Python, Rails, Node. Tech Lead experience. These days I reach for AI tooling first - but I know what's underneath.

## Current work

- **Aura Intelligence Group** - Voice AI systems, n8n workflows powering the operation
- **Client projects** - n8n automations, AI integrations, infrastructure hardening

## Tech

`n8n` `Python` `Rails` `TypeScript` `Docker` `Ansible` `PostgreSQL` `Anthropic` `Gemini` `Supabase` `Grafana` `Loki`

## Philosophy

Build systems that compound. Ship to production. Operate what you build.
